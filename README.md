## Install dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

## Run
```bash
bun run start-bun # Start using Bun
bun run start-node # Start using Node.js
```

When using Bun, Gecko-based browsers will not load the provided font and Chromium-based browsers will not load the images. When using Node, everything should load as normal.
